Got it! You've provided the key technologies used. Since I still can't directly access the GitHub link, I'll generate a comprehensive README.md file based on the information you've given me and standard practices for projects using Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS.

Event Discovery Platform
Project Overview
This project is a modern, responsive web application designed to help users discover upcoming and recommended events. It features a robust authentication system, fetches dynamic event data from external APIs, and provides an intuitive user interface that adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices. Built with a contemporary tech stack including React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, the application prioritizes performance, maintainability, and a delightful user experience.

Features
User Authentication: Secure signup and login functionalities with robust validation and session management.
Responsive Design: Optimized layouts and interactions ensuring a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
Hero Section: A prominent banner highlighting key messages about upcoming events.
Recommended Shows: A dynamically loaded, horizontally scrollable section showcasing 8 hand-picked recommended events.
Upcoming Events: A vertically scrollable list of numerous upcoming events, implementing lazy loading for efficient data retrieval.
API Integration: Fetches and displays event data from provided REST APIs, distinguishing between recommended and upcoming event types.
Modern UI/UX: Built with shadcn/ui components and styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, consistent, and highly customizable design.
Performance Optimization: Lazy loading for upcoming events and efficient asset bundling via Vite to ensure fast page loads and smooth interactions.
Technologies Used
This project is built with the following cutting-edge technologies:

Vite: A lightning-fast build tool that offers an incredibly quick development experience for modern web projects.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code quality, readability, and maintainability.
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling a component-based and declarative approach to UI development.
shadcn/ui: A collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It provides beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI primitives.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development by composing styles directly in your markup.
